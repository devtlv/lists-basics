# Reminder:  
# A list element can be any data type, thus it can also be a list. For example, a list of lists, where each sub list contains a name and an age:
# 
# ```python
# my_family = [['John', 14], ['Micheal', 18], ['Dorit', 20]]
# ```
# ***
# Create a list of your 3 favorites actors, this list should be a list of lists, each sub list is in this format: `[actor_name, reason_you_like_him]`.  
# Use this list to print something like this:
# ```python
# My favourite actors are:
# Homer Simpsons, because he is so funny.
# Johnny Depp, because he acts so good.
# Me, because it's me.
# ```
